## üìä **Current Implementation Status**

### **‚úÖ Working Features (Available Now)**
1. **Medical Conversation Filter**
   - Filters out social pleasantries ("How are you?", "Nice weather")
   - Extracts medical symptoms, medications, instructions
   - Categorizes content (symptom_assessment, medication_management, etc.)
   - Provides confidence scores and relevance ratings

2. **Real-time Integration**
   - Live filtering during transcription
   - Configurable relevance threshold
   - Visual feedback on what was filtered
   - Seamless GUI integration

### **üî¨ Example Medical Filter Output**
```
Original: "Good morning, doctor! How are you? I've been having chest pain and took some ibuprofen. The weather is nice today."

Filtered: "[SYMPTOM_ASSESSMENT] I've been having chest pain and took some ibuprofen."

Extracted Info:
- Symptoms: ["chest pain"]  
- Medications: ["ibuprofen"]
- Categories: ["symptom_assessment", "medication_management"]
- Relevance Score: 0.75
- Confidence: 0.85
```
